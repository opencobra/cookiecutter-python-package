# Cookiecutter Template for openCOBRA Python Packages


## Usage

Create a Python virtual environment. You can [read this guide to learn more](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)
about them and how to create one. Alternatively, particularly if you are a 
Windows or Mac user, you can also use [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/).

After creating a virtual environment, it's as simple as:

```
pip install cookiecutter
cookiecutter https://github.com/opencobra/cookiecutter-python-package
```

and answering the questions that follow.
